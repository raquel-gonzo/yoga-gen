# Yoga-Gen
Using a yoga pose API created by [@rebeccaestes](https://github.com/rebeccaestes/yoga_api), users can browse a library of yoga poses to create their own flow. Made with React and Bulma, currently hosted on Netlify. Images by [Claire Jones](https://thenounproject.com/hivernoir/collection/yoga/?oq=yoga&cidx=2). 

### Backlog 
- Move the library of poses to a Baas platform.
- Have a random tile picker for generating random sequences.
- A button for downloading a random sequence. 
- Use a different API, such as one that [@Stuwert](https://github.com/Stuwert/yoga-builder) created.
